			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve started populating the <a href="http://linuxplumbersconf.org/2009/program/">Program</a> page with available videos, including Linus&#8217;s git tutorial and some of the security, networking and x  sessions. We&#8217;d like to thank the <a href="http://video.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation video site</a> which is hosting these for us.  Not all of the sessions were taped, unfortunately &#8211; only the sessions in one of the tracks/rooms all day long were taped &#8211; something we hope that next year&#8217;s organizing committee will be able to improve upon!</p>
<p>A few broken URLs and slide pointers have been cleaned up. If you don&#8217;t see your slides here please do send/ resend them to us at <a href="mailto:contact@linuxplumbersconf.org">contact@linuxplumbersconf.org</a>. Speakers who want to add their updates, summaries or notes on the sessions can do so by editing their proposal pages as well (linked to on the <a href="http://linuxplumbersconf.org/2009/program/">Program</a> page).</p>
<p>If you have any questions or suggestions for next year&#8217;s conference, please do send in your comments to us at <a href="mailto:contact@linuxplumbersconf.org">contact@linuxplumbersconf.org.</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2009 Linux Plumbers Conference Organizing Committee would like to thank all of our generous sponsors, our fantastic speakers, our enthusiastic attendees, our superb program committee, the Linux Foundation&#8217;s indefatigible Angela Brown, the very supportive Linux Foundation Board, the efficient Marriott team,  Oregon State University and its wonderful Open Source Lab which hosts our computer infrastructure, and all of the tremendous people who volunteered to help us pull off an outstanding conference! We had a remarkably successful event and we hope a good time was had by all.</p>
<p><strong>So thank you!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conference Material</strong><br />
We&#8217;re adding all of the slides, videos and BoF notes that we can get our hands on to our <a href="http://linuxplumbersconf.org/2009/program/">Program</a> page  as they become available. We hope to have the videos online in the next couple of weeks. If you took notes and have a write-up, a summary, photographs, video or any other material related to the conference that you&#8217;d like to share with us,  please <a href="mailto:contact@linuxplumbersconf.org">contact us!</a>. We&#8217;d love to gather whatever we can and build it up into a comprehensive repository. We&#8217;d particularly like to hear about progress as a result of discussions at LPC: did you resolve a problem? Implement a feature? Get code submitted? We&#8217;d love to hear about it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we were unfortunately unable to open registration this evening for LPC as planned, we&#8217;re urging conference attendees to get an early start on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p><strong>We will open registration around 7:30AM, PT</strong>. The conference <strong>begins at 9:00AM PT</strong> with our welcome and<strong> David S. Miller&#8217;s keynote address</strong>.</p>
<p>As we anticipate that we&#8217;ll need to process the entire LPC attendee population prior to the conference start for logistical reasons, we&#8217;re hoping all 315 of you arrive at a beautifully optimized constant rate at  our registration desk in the time interval between 7:30AM and 8:59AM.</p>
<p>We suspect that&#8217;s possibly a tad unlikely. We suspect the much more likely scenario is a rather ill-distributed bell or poisson. Of course, given that practically all of our attendees are software engineers, perhaps it should not surprise us if 305 of you show up at 8:59, thereby maximizing sleep and minimizing time spent waiting for Dave Miller to start talking (while the remaining arrive at 6:47AM having taken the only convenient max train). Please don&#8217;t do that. Be kind to your conference organizers! Come early! Come staggered!</p>
<p>But seriously, our trained professional registration folks are well prepared for these sorts of things and are confident of getting all of you done really quickly.</p>
<p>Enjoy the conference!</p>
